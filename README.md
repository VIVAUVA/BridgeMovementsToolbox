# BridgeMovementsToolbox

This tool takes a shapefile of bridges and colors them based on displacement data over time. Points are first filtered by height to make sure that they are on the bridge. After filtering, if any point moves greater than the warning threshold (inches/year) then the bridge status is set to WARNING. If any point moves greater than the critical threshold (inches/month) then the bridge status is set to CRITICAL. These thresholds have default values but may be user adjusted. If there are no problematic points, the bridge status is set to GOOD. The data are noisy, so a running average of calculated velocities is taken to perform the analysis.The status IDs and bridge coordinates are printed to the output attribute table. A symbology layer is required as input to allow the tool to color the bridges based on status ID - red for CRITICAL, yellow for WARNING, and green for GOOD. When the tool has completed running, if a CRITICAL bridge was found, the tool will zoom to that location. Otherwise, coordinates and the status for each bridge appear in a pop-up window (when running the tool in foreground) and in the output table.
